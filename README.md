# Choco OS

Choco OS is a 64-bit operating system for playing retro games! Currently supports timer/keyboard interrupts, as well as its own shell prompt and some games (one).

#### Future Plans
- Implement dynamic memory allocation
- Add more games! (pong)



## How to run
On Mac, simply install the `x86_64-elf-gcc` through Homebrew and in the root directory, run `gmake run`.
Windows/Linux: The GNUmakefile in /Kernel will have to be modified with the appropriate compiler
